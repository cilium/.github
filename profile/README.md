[Cilium](https://cilium.io/) is an open source, cloud native solution for providing, securing, and observing network connectivity between workloads, fueled by the revolutionary Kernel technology [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/).

### Cilium

Cilium is used to provide and transparently secure network connectivity and load balancing between application workloads such as application containers, processes, or VMs. Cilium operates at Layer 3/4 to provide traditional networking and security services as well as Layer 7 to protect and secure use of modern application protocols such as HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka. Cilium is a part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) and is their most advanced and widely used CNI for Kubernetes. Check out the [Getting Started Guides](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/) to try it out.

Cilium has hundreds of [adopters](https://cilium.io/adopters) around the world including Bell Canada, Capital One, Google, The New York Times, and Yahoo. If you are using Cilium, [add yourself](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/USERS.md) to the list today!

### Hubble

[Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble) is a fully distributed networking and security observability platform for cloud native workloads. It is built on top of [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) and [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) to enable deep visibility into the communication and behavior of services as well as the networking infrastructure in a completely transparent manner. Hubble helps teams understand service dependencies and communication maps, operational monitoring and alerting, application monitoring, and security observability.

### Tetragon

[Tetragon](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon) enables powerful realtime, eBPF-based Security Observability and Runtime Enforcement. Tetragon detects and is able to react to security-significant events, such as:



* Process execution events
* System call activity
* I/O activity including network & file access

When used in a Kubernetes environment, Tetragon is Kubernetes-aware - that is, it understands Kubernetes identities such as namespaces and pods - so that security event detection can be configured for specific individual workloads.
